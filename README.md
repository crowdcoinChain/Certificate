Proposal:

Create an online micro service that allow the users to:

1) Get the hash of a document without uploading it (Improvement light hash, random selects 1 to 100 subsections of 100 bytes)
 
2) Write the hash on any blockchain.
 
3) Selecting the file on the local machine check the hash they provide.
 
4) Selectin a file on the local machine or inserting the has get the timestamp of the block as response.
